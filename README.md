Text processing in NLP (Natural Language Processing) refers to the manipulation, analysis, and transformation of textual data to extract useful information and derive insights. It involves various techniques and methodologies to preprocess and transform raw text into a format suitable for NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and more. Text processing can be done using:

1)Regular Expressions  

Basic text processing requires the identification of sentence and word boundaries (tokenization).Often it is beneficial to reduce the number of different word forms and token (lemmatization / stemming). To achieve that regular expressions can be used. 

Tokenization: Regular expressions can be utilized to define custom tokenization rules based on specific patterns in the text.
